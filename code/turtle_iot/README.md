# Solar Demonstrator "Turtle" ( 🌐 IoT-Ready )

This sketch (`.ino`-file) contains a modified version of the original turtle-firmware, augmented with a WiFi/MQTT-based uplink to an MQTT broker.

## Running this application

In order to run this application execute the following steps:

1. Create a copy of the `configuration.default.cpp` file, acting as a template. Name the copy to `configuration.cpp`.
2. Open `configuration.cpp` for editing.
3. Fill in the WiFi’s data with the  information provided by your workshop host:
   - Workshop ID
   - SSID
   - password
4. Fill in the MQTT data as assigned by your workshop host:
   - Wokshop ID
   - Team ID
   - Username
   - Password
5. Doublecheck the MQTT configuration with your workshop instructions:
   - Server
   - Port

## MQTT concept

This project exposes multiple datapoints that can be used. Inputs and outputs are separated by their path:

- Inputs: `ctrl/...`
- Outputs `data/...`

The available datapoints are:

| **Key** | **Direction** | **MQTT path** | **Format**     | **Description**                                 |
| :------------ | :-----------------: | :------------------ | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| _heartbeat_ |         Out         | `data/heartbeat`  | [Heartbeat](#heartbeat) | Heartbeat signal sent every second to signal activity |
| _mirror_    |         Out         | `data/mirror`     | [Plain](#plain-values)  | see[Mirror feature](#mirror-feature)                     |
| _mirror_    |         In         | `ctrl/mirror`     | [Plain](#plain-values)  | see[Mirror feature](#mirror-feature)                     |
| _voltage_   |         Out         | `data/voltage`    | [Scalar](#scalars)      | Voltage produced on the solar cell                    |

### Scalars

For simplified processing on the ThingsBoard end and better forward compatibility, every data point is wrapped within a JSON-object. For scalar values, the object is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "value": <the value>
}
```

Objects of such a structure are automatically interpret by the EduDemoS ThingsBoard instance to scalar key-value-pairs. However, it also allows for further extension of the datapoint without breaking existing data formats by simply adding further keys to the JSON-object in the future.

### Heartbeat

The heartbeat signal is a JSON-object consisting of two keys:

- state - a toggling string-value switching between `on` and `off` automatically.
- mirror - same value as the datapoint `data/mirror`

```json
{
  "state": "off",
  "mirror": false
}
```

### Mirror feature

For demonstrating downlink (i.e. sending through the broker to the device), the software features a mirroring service. This service exposes an input under `ctrl/mirror` and an output through `data/mirror`.

The service follows the following logic:

Whenever a value is set for `ctrl/mirror`, the value is interpret by the following rule:

|  `ctrl/mirror`  | `data/mirror` |
| :---------------: | :-------------: |
|        on        |       off       |
| _anything else_ |       on       |
